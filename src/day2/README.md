## Problem 1

The problem here is to keep track of two variables: Depth and Horizontal position.
Depth can increase or decrease, whereas Horizontal position can only increase.
Initial idea: Use pattern matching to evaluate and extract the values from each line in the file.

*Recursion*
I ended up writing a recursive function that continually processes the head of the list, and 
then passes the rest of the list in as an argument for the next recursion.
One takeaway for me was I learned that recursive functions have their last argument both as 
input- and return- parameter.

The answer is obtained by multiplying the final horizontal position with the depth.
The answer is: 2215080
