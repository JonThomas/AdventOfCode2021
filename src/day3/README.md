The problem here is to consider 1000 bitmasks of 12 digits, and find the most common bit for each corresponding position in the 1000 bitmasks. The most common bits creates the "gamma rate" in binary. The "epsilon rate" is found in a similar fashion, but using the lest commin bits.

The answer is found by multiplying the decimal gamma and epsilon rates.

The answer is:
